<h1>Ohio Evictions</h1>
"The lack of affordable housing sits at the root of a host of social problems, from poverty and homelessness to educational disparities and health care. That means understanding the eviction crisis is critical to effectively addressing these problems and reducing inequality." - <a href="https://evictionlab.org/">The Eviction Lab</a>

The Covid-19 pandemic has only strengthened inequalities and inequities. There have also been various local, state, or federal legislation occur during the pandemic in order to cease evictions for eligible tentants. 

In this visualization, we wanted to explore a state that never created a state-wide eviction moratorium during the pandemic but did have several local moratoriums. Note the federal moratorium has only been in place from X to Y.
